# Title: Analyzing Proficiency Patterns in Test Results Using Clustering and Augmentation Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and notebooks for the research paper titled "Analyzing Proficiency Patterns in Test Results Using Clustering and Augmentation Algorithms." The paper investigates the utilization of clustering analysis on student test results and explores its potential impact on interpretation. By employing clustering techniques, the study aims to identify meaningful patterns in student performance.

## Notebooks Description
1. **Data Preprocessing.ipynb**: The notebook contains the data preprocessing steps applied to the raw student test result dataset.
2. **Clustering Analysis.ipynb**: This notebook showcases the clustering analysis on the original student test result dataset without data augmentation.
3. **Augmentation.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the data augmentation process to create a synthetic.
4. **Clustering Analysis - Augmented Data.ipynb**: In this notebook, we perform clustering analysis on the augmented dataset to identify distinct groups of students based on their test performance patterns.
